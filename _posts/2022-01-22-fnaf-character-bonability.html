title: "Council Makes Official Declaration: Which FNaF Characters are Okay to Bone"
description: "It's time to ask the real questions."
author: GINH

<p>Ever since 2014, popular indie horror game Five Nights at Freddy’s has been a common point of interest for furries across the Continent. As the series features mainly anthropomorphic characters, there is often a query from within the Nation: “Can I bone the animatronics?”</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, most of them would be more interested in killing you. For those of you who are into that, exercise caution. Otherwise, in your fantasies, the Council has issued the following official list of each character and the acceptability of your wish to become more than intimate with it.</p>

<p>The Council’s official list and reasons are in full below. A briefer, more casual list and description will be provided at the end of the comprehensive list for the consumption of a more general audience.</p>

<h3>Series Humans</h3>
<p>Scarcely of interest to TYT’s reader audience outside of human x anthro canonicity, the series does contain a few humans. All humans present in the series are subject to standard consent-based rulings.</p>

<p>Notable humans include William Afton prior to his death by springlock failure, Micheal Afton prior to his final death in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator’s fire, Phone Guy/Dude, and Vanessa (with potential overall exception due to her presumed condition - TBD).</p>

<h3>Shortened Explanation</h3>
<span class="no-spacing">FNaF 1: All have dead children spirits - no. Golden Freddy has two dead children, so double no.
    FNaF 2: Withered Animatronics probably have dead kids in them by this point, so no. Toy Animatronics are more testy, but still presumed to be haunted by kids, so no. Marionette is a definite for a dead kid, so no. Mangle is haunted by a dog (still no). Shadow Freddy and Bonnie are hallucinations, so it’s up to you if they can even be fucked.
    FNaF 3: All of them are hallucinations. Except for Springtrap, who is haunted by an adult capable of consent. Except, no - his ability to consent is presumably mostly intact? But his coding still holds control over him, which makes it uncertain how okay it is.
    FNaF 4: All of them are hallucinations, your call. The only one with a real, physical form to the hallucination is Nightmare Foxy, and the Council reminds you of D-5477-J if you were intrigued by specifically that.
    FNaF SL: Circus Baby is haunted by a dead kid, so no. Ballora is generally considered to be haunted by an adult woman (Mrs. Afton), which raises the same concerns as Springtrap. The little things are too child-like. Funtime Foxy, Freddy, and Bon Bon are probably fine. Ennard contains Baby, so no deal.
    FFPS: Most of those newer animatronics were probably made when William Afton was dead and out of commission, so presumably none of them are haunted. Molten Freddy is just Ennard without Baby, but she was the only contention point, so it’s fine to bone. Scraptrap is Springtrap, so same ordeal. Scrap Baby is still Baby, so no. Lefty isn’t haunted, so he’s totally cool, but he comes as a package deal with the Marionette, who is not okay to screw - make sure she’s been removed and Lefty is all yours.
    FNaF HW: Glitchtrap is weird because it’s pretty heavily implied it’s an extension or copy of William Afton’s (adult human capable of consent) consciousness. As a programmed entity, however, his ability to consent is dubious at best. All the others are just digital so you get a tentative “sure.”
    FNaF SB: Glamrock Freddy is presumably haunted by Micheal Afton, who is arguably less capable of consent than Springtrap because Glamrock Freddy is not even aware of who he is. Parts of the Council are still in debate over whether or not Glamrock Freddy is its own entity capable of consent or an intolerable alteration of an individual’s consciousness (and therefore unable to consent). Despite the fact that at least nine people (whose ages are contested) have died at the Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex™, there is no reason to believe any of the other animatronics are haunted. Therefore, everyone from Roxanne to the map bot are fuckable. Jury’s still out on the relationship between the Daycare Attendant’s consciousnesses, though.</span>

<h3>Glossary</h3>
<span class="no-spacing"><u>D-1471-A</u>: Council Decision #1471, part A - ruling which declares hallucinations which are “real, without physical form, but not the manifestation of the viewer’s own internal problems” are real enough to fuck.
    <u>D-1471-B</u>: Council Decision #1471, part B - ruling which declares that “entities [...] exclusive to the digital interface of a computer, even if capable of projecting a non-real mass into the physical world” are real enough to fuck.
    <u>D-5477-J</u>: Council Decision #5477, part J - ruling which declares “individuals are permitted to have sex with nonsentient plushes, plushies, and/or stuffed animals [...] as long as it is their own, however the Council will officially regard that as ‘fucked up, man’.”</span>
