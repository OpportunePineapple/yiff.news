From the beginning of human history, man has attempted to find
patterns in every aspect of life and assign meaning to them
as symbols. It's how we communicate meaning to other people
and survive in the social world that we live in.

Food, sex, drugs - nothing is sacred from this symbolic interactionism.
A prime example of this is numbers. One might think that a construct
so mathematically, scientifically pure as numbers couldn't be corrupted.
Indeed, that presumption turns out to be false.

Over time, humorous meanings have been assigned to seemingly arbitrary
numbers. With how many there are, it can be tough to remember them all.
So then, here is a helpful list, which may be occasionally updated to
reflect the times.
